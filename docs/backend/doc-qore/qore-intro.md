# Qore Introduction

## What is Qore?

![BaaS Concept](/img/documentation/qore/qore-logo.svg)

Qore is Backend as a service (BaaS) platform that can **leverage backend services (such as user authentication, database management, as well as cloud storage) without building or maintaining it**. Developers are able to integrate all the backend functionality they need **via API (a way for a program to make a request of another program) and SDK (a kit for builing software) offered by Qore**, so they only have to write and maintain the frontend side.

## Why use Qore?
