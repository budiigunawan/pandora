# Background

Let's discover **the background of Pandora**.

## What is Pandora?

![Pandora logo](/img/logo2.png)

Pandora (**Paragonian's Documentation for Application Development**) is a platform for all development documentations that used by Paragonian.

Pandora will stores `frontend documentations` and `backend documentations`. These documentations will help developers(_especially newcomers_) to speed up the development learning process.

Developers also will learn how to apply best practices on their project by learning `ways of working documentations`. These documentations will help developers to deliver good quality application.

## Why Pandora is created?

1. Paragon didn't have centralized platform to store all development documentations
2. Paragon didn't have documented software development standards
