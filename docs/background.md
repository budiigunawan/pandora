Let's discover **the background of Pandora**.

## What is Pandora

Pandora is an abbreviation for **Paragonian's Documentation for React Application**.

This Documentation will show you how to develop a web application step by step using **Qore for the backend, React JS for the frontend, git version control, and serverless deployment**. These tools will help us to speed up the development process. We also will learn how to apply best practices on **preview code use ESLint, code review by peer, and page preview before merge to development branch**, so we can prevent bugs that will appear in the future.
