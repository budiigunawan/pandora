# React Introduction

## What is React?

React is a Javascript library for building user interface. React is one of the most popular ones, with **over 100,000 stars on Github**. Many well-known companies use React like Facebook, Airbnb, and Dropbox.

## Prerequisites

There are a few things you should know in advance before you start playing around with React. If you've never used JavaScript or the DOM at all before, for example, I would get more familiar with those before trying to tackle React.

- Basic familiarity with **HTML & CSS.**
- Basic knowledge of **Javascript** and Programming.
- Basic Understanding of **the DOM.**
- Familiarity with **ES6 syntax and features.**

## Setup and Installation

The React team primarily recommends these solutions:

- If you’re **learning React** or **creating a new single-page app**, use `Create React App`.
- If you’re building a **server-rendered website with Node.js**, try `Next.js`.
- If you’re building a **static content-oriented website**, try `Gatsby`.
